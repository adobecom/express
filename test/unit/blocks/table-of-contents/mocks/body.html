  <p>Pride is an annual celebration that takes place in June in the US (although other locations may celebrate at different times) that honors and celebrates all who identify as gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, intersex, queer, asexual, agender, and two-spirit. While June is a popular time for marches and other activities for the LGBTQIA2S+ community to come together and show their pride, it’s no secret that it’s taken many years of hardship and resistance to get to this place.</p>
  <p>Join us as we look back on all that the LGBTQIA2S+ plus community has accomplished and overcome through the years to give us the freedom to loudly and proudly celebrate Pride today.</p>

  <h2 id="the-origins-of-pride-month">The origins of Pride month</h2>
  <p>Why do we celebrate pride in June? Pride commemorates the Stonewall riots, which began on June 28, 1969, when the police raided the Stonewall Inn bar in New York City’s Greenwich Village. Although the raiding of gay bars was nothing new at the time (nor was resistance from the customers), the Stonewall uprising was notable due to its six days of rebellion and became a key turning point in the LGBTQIA2S+ movement. The event sparked outrage and encouraged greater activism for the gay community across the globe, essentially kicking off the gay rights movement. In June of the following year, hundreds of people gathered to march down Greenwich Village’s Christopher Street, in what is largely considered to be the first Pride march.</p>

  <h2 id="the-origins-of-the-pride-flag">The origins of the Pride flag</h2>
  <p>We all know that the rainbow flag has become synonymous with Pride, but where and when did this begin? Let’s take a minute to understand the meaning behind the flag before we use it in our designs.</p>
  <p>It was in 1978 that the Pride flag first made its debut in San Francisco, designed by artist Gilbert Baker and featuring eight colors:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Hot pink to symbolize sexuality</li>
      <li>Red to symbolize life</li>
      <li>Orange to symbolize healing</li>
      <li>Yellow to symbolize the sun</li>
      <li>Green to symbolize nature</li>
      <li>Blue to symbolize magic and art</li>
      <li>Indigo to symbolize serenity and harmony</li>
      <li>Violet to symbolize the spirit of LGBTQIA2S+ people</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Of course, the six-color flag we more commonly use today (featuring red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple) was created due to a desire to split the flag in half for ease of decoration, as well as due to an unavailability of some of the fabric colors. This flag was originally used the following year in 1979.</p>
  <p>In June 2018, however, the Pride flag received another upgrade from designer and activist Daniel Quasar to include a chevron to the hoist of this six-color flag. The added chevron represents marginalized LGBTQIA2S+ communities of color, those living with HIV/AIDS, community members who’ve been lost, as well as transgender and non-binary people. The chevron is positioned on the left edge of the flag and points to the right, representing that achieving equality is still in progress, especially for the communities that the chevron symbolizes. This version is known as the Progress Pride flag.</p>
  <h2 id="how-to-celebrate-pride-as-a-business">How to celebrate Pride as a business</h2>
  <p>While we’ve seen support and acceptance of LGBTQIA2S+ communities grow over the years, there is always so much more that can be done to help people feel welcome and celebrated during Pride, as well as throughout the year. Taking this month as an opportunity to show that your business supports and celebrates Pride is a wonderful way to do your part as an ally and lead the charge for even greater acceptance of LGBTQIA2S+ communities in everyday life.</p>
  <p>There are many ways in which businesses can celebrate Pride this June. Some may choose to host Pride-themed events or release limited edition Pride-themed products (such as a rainbow-branded version of their usual products). Many businesses might make tweaks to their usual branding to show their Pride by integrating the flag or offer special discounts or deals in celebration of Pride month, while others will express their support using social media posts or by donating a cut of their proceeds to Pride-related charities. While these efforts should be made year-round, Pride is also the perfect time to amplify the voices of LGBTQIA2S+ influencers in your industry through collaborations and partnerships or by giving LGBTQIA2S+-owned businesses a social media shoutout.</p>
